## Setup

### Reference data directory

You'll need a directory for storing data. You can either start from scratch with an empty directory, or use an existing database and image set. See [this repo](https://github.com/MingDai/HookCatcherData) for example.

To point at the data, create a new _user_settings.py_ file in the project root.
Add the local directory that your data is stored in:

```python
DATABASE_DIR = "../HookCatcherData"
```
Add the Github Repository that you are testing for:
From example url: https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_GITHUB_REPO
```python
GIT_REPO = "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_GITHUB_REPO"
```
Add your Github [personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/)
```python
GIT_OAUTH = 'YOU_AUTH_ID_HERE'
```

### Start server

```
$ python manage.py runserver (port)
```
